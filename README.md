# GitHub-Familiarization
*Exercise for GEOG 728 Programming for Geographic Analysis at Kansas State University*

### Objective

Become familiar with GitHub as an online repository for your coding work and GitHub Desktop for managing your work locally and reintegrating it with your online repository.

### Task

Accept a GitHub assignment, clone the instructor repository on your GitHub account and locally as a new personal repository, edit a file in the repository to provide a brief biography of yourself, commit the changes made to your local copy of the file, and push those changes back to your GitHub account and assignment repository. Finally, seek assistance by posting an issue in GitHub.

### Required Software

The following software programs will be used in this exercise.  Each is available on the laboratory computers in S3014A.  If you plan to use your own personal computer this semester, please download and install.
1.  Notepad++ - https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/
2.  GitHubDesktop - https://desktop.github.com/

### Procedures

Step #1 - Create a GitHub Account

Login to GitHub (https://github.com) and create a free personal account.  I recommend choosing a user name that make it easy for me to recognize your identity.  GitHub will serve as your online storage for coding work this semester.  I will be able to access your class-related code, provide feedback, answer your questions, and grade your assignments.  You will also have a permanent copy of your work that you retain and control after the semester ends.

Step #2 - Start GitHub Desktop
After creating your GitHub acount, start and login to **GitHub Desktop** using your new GitHub account credentials.

Step #3 - Accept the Assignment Invitation and Clone a Template Repository
When you are assigned coding work this semester, I will send you an email message with a link.  Simply click on this link to "accept" the assignment.  This automatically starts the process of copying a template repository containing instructions and other important files that I provide as a starting point.  This procedure is also known as cloning.  The cloned respository will follow the naming convention "template repository name" - "your GitHub username". 

Step #4 - Create a Local Clone
Within GitHub, find your  newly created assignment repository, click the green Code button, and choose Open with GitHubDesktop.  GitHub Desktop gives you the option to open the locally cloned files in an editor program (e.g., Notepad++), viewing the repo files in Windows Explorer, or opening the repo page on GitHub.

Step #5 - View Files in Windows Explorer 
In GitHub Desktop, choose the option to view the files of your repository in Explorer.

Step #6 - Edit bio.txt in Notepad++
Find the file <code>biography.txt</code>, open it in Notepad++, and enter the information requested.  You are welcome to include any additional biographical data, or other information, that you would like me to be aware of this semester.

Step #7 - Describe and Commit Changes to Master
After editing the bio.txt file, you should see a snippet of the file in GitHub Desktop that highlights the changes you made.  Characterize your edits with a summary and short description (bottom left corner of GitHub Desktop), then choose Commit to Master.  This workflow allows you to maintain a record of changes made - essentially multiple versions of the same file - without having to have multiple copies of your file (e.g., bio1.txt, bio2.txt, etc.)

Step #8 - Push Changes to Origin Repo on GitHub
After you have made all of the changes you want, you now have to sync these changes - which apply only to the local version of the repo - to your original repo on GitHub. Once you have committed changes to master, you will have the option to push the commits to the origin remote.  Click the blue Push Origin button.

Step #9 - Verify Changes in GitHub
In GitHub Desktop, choose the option to open your repository page on GitHub in your Web browser.  Alternatively, you can simply open a Web browser and navigate to github.com.  Find the updated bio.txt file and open it to confirm that your local changes are now reflected in the online repo.

Step #10 - Raise an Issue
You can ask questions of me directly in GitHub by raising an issue.  In your repo on GitHub, find and click "Issue" in the menu at the top of the page.  Next, click on the green New Issue button.  This opens a chat-style window that allow you to pose questions and for me to provide a response.  This feature also helps us maintain a permanent record of our online conversation.  Use this issue to ask me a question!

### Submission

After completing the requested edits to <code>biography.txt</code> make sure that you have (1) committed the changes to the main branch and provided a short summary and description of your changes.  Double check your work by reviewing your repository on GitHub.
